# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Code Orchestrator will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- Terminal no longer wraps its output to ~2 characters wide. A hidden/background session tab (or one measured before layout settled) could make the fit addon report a 2-column width to the PTY, so Claude Code rendered everything wrapped to 2–3 characters. The terminal now refuses to fit or resize while it's hidden or not yet laid out, never reports an absurdly small column count, and re-fits once web fonts finish loading.

### Added
- Refresh button in the detached Notes & Docs preview window (top-right, next to the window controls). Click it to reload the note from disk and re-render — handy for picking up external edits (e.g. a Claude session writing to the `.md`) without switching back to the editor.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- Usage Dashboard time-range filter: pick **Last 24 hours / 7 days / 30 days / 90 days / All time** (default 7 days). Every panel — the headline cards, tokens-over-time chart, by-model breakdown, activity-by-hour, and top projects — reflects the selected window. The "All time" panel stays full-history as a fixed reference.
- Usage Dashboard auto-refresh control: choose **Off / 30s / 1m / 5m / 15m** (default 5 min). Both controls remember your choice across restarts.

### Changed
- Stats are now scanned once into per-day buckets (cached ~5 min) and any time window is derived from them instantly, so switching the range never re-reads your transcripts.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Nested folders in Notes & Docs: organize markdown into a collapsible folder tree, move notes/folders by drag-and-drop or a right-click "Move to…" menu, and create folders/subfolders. Folders are real subdirectories on disk.
- "What's New" popup that appears once after an update, showing recent versions with dates and highlights (curated in `src/shared/release-notes.ts`).

### Changed
- Board cards now distinguish two attention states: a green dot when Claude has finished and is waiting for your prompt, and a pulsing orange dot when it's waiting for a decision (permission, plan approval, or a select-menu choice). Detection scans the session's terminal output (ANSI-stripped) for Claude's interactive prompt.
- Usage Dashboard polish: roomier stat cards and section padding, larger icon-only Refresh button, and a cleaner chart tooltip.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Usage Dashboard: click the token badge at the bottom of the sidebar to open a full dashboard of your Claude Code usage — today's tokens / messages / sessions / tool calls / estimated cost, a 30-day tokens-over-time chart, a by-model breakdown (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku), activity-by-hour, all-time totals, and top projects. Charts powered by recharts.

### Fixed
- Sidebar token badge no longer gets stuck on a stale day. Usage is now computed live from the session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects` (streamed with bounded memory) instead of Claude Code's rarely-refreshed `stats-cache.json`, so it always reflects the current day.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Application icon: embedded in the Windows exe/installer (no longer the default Electron icon), shown on the dev window/taskbar, and used as the sidebar logo.
- `author` field in package.json (publisher metadata).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Resizable divider between the markdown editor and live preview in Notes & Docs (drag to set the split, clamped 20–80%).
- Pop-out the Notes & Docs preview into a separate, movable window (toolbar button) that live-syncs the rendered markdown and theme — handy for keeping a note's preview visible while a card session is open or on a second monitor.

### Fixed
- Dim the title-bar caption buttons while a full-screen modal is open, so the OS-drawn button strip no longer stays bright over the dimmed backdrop (session modal, settings, card dialog, delete confirmation).

### Changed
- Make "Check for Updates" testable in development: `electron-updater` now reads `dev-app-update.yml` and forces the dev update config when unpackaged.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-27
