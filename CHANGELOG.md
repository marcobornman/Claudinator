# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Code Orchestrator will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- Dim the title-bar caption buttons while a full-screen modal is open, so the OS-drawn button strip no longer stays bright over the dimmed backdrop (session modal, settings, card dialog, delete confirmation).

### Changed
- Make "Check for Updates" testable in development: `electron-updater` now reads `dev-app-update.yml` and forces the dev update config when unpackaged.

### Added
- Kanban board with 5 columns (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Validating, Complete)
- Drag-and-drop card reordering with dnd-kit
- Card tags, search, and filtering
- Integrated xterm.js terminals for Claude Code CLI sessions
- Session status tracking (starting, running, waiting, stopped, error)
- Claude conversation ID tracking for session resume
- Git status and diff panel per session
- Dark and light themes with full CSS variable customization
