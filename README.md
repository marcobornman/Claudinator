# Claude Code Orchestrator

A desktop Kanban board for managing parallel [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI sessions.

Organize tasks on a drag-and-drop board, spin up terminal sessions per card, and monitor multiple Claude conversations side by side.

## Features

- **Kanban board** -- Five columns (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Validating, Complete) with drag-and-drop reordering, tags, search, and filtering.
- **Integrated terminals** -- Start Claude Code CLI sessions directly from cards. View real-time output in tabbed xterm.js terminals with keyboard input support.
- **Session tracking** -- Monitors session status (starting / running / waiting / stopped / error) with idle detection. Tracks Claude conversation IDs for session resume.
- **Git panel** -- View git status and diffs for the project directory of any active session.
- **Themes** -- Dark and light modes with full CSS variable customization. Create, import, and export custom themes.
- **PAT management** -- Store personal access tokens that get injected as environment variables into every session.
- **Rules** -- Define instructions that are applied to every Claude Code session via CLAUDE.md.
- **Auto-update** -- Check for and install updates from GitHub Releases (Settings > About).
- **Persistence** -- Board state, sessions, and settings are saved automatically across restarts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18
- Windows (the packaged build currently targets Windows x64)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sinofdreams/Claudinator.git
cd Claudinator
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Package (Windows installer)

```bash
npm run package:win
```

Produces an NSIS installer in the `dist/` directory.

## Auto-Update

The app checks for updates from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Sinofdreams/Claudinator/releases) via `electron-updater`. Open **Settings > About** and click **Check for Updates**. Downloads are user-initiated -- nothing happens automatically in the background.

### Publishing a release

1. Bump the `version` in `package.json` (e.g., `0.1.0` -> `0.2.0`).
2. Run `npm run package:win`.
3. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Sinofdreams/Claudinator/releases) and create a new release.
4. Set the tag to match the version (e.g., `v0.2.0`).
5. Upload **both** files from the `dist/` directory:
   - `claude-orchestrator-<version>-setup.exe` -- the installer
   - `latest.yml` -- **required** for auto-update detection; `electron-updater` reads this file to determine if a newer version is available

> **Important:** If you forget to upload `latest.yml`, existing installations will not detect the new release. Always upload both files.
