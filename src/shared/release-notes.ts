    summary: 'Terminal wrapping fix + popout preview refresh.',
    highlights: [
      'Fixed the terminal occasionally wrapping its output to ~2 characters wide — a hidden or not-yet-laid-out session tab could report a tiny width to the CLI. Terminals now only resize when properly visible.',
      'Added a refresh button to the detached Notes & Docs preview window (top-right) that reloads the note from disk — handy for picking up external edits, like a Claude session writing to the file.'
    ]

    version: '0.1.7',
    date: '2026-06-22',
    summary: 'Filter your usage by time range.',
    highlights: [
      'Usage Dashboard now has a time-range filter — Last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or All time (defaults to 7 days). Every chart and card reflects the window you pick.',
      'New auto-refresh control (Off / 30s / 1m / 5m / 15m, default 5 min). Both choices are remembered across restarts.',
      'Switching the range is instant — stats are scanned once and any window is derived from a cache, so it never re-reads your transcripts.'

    version: '0.1.6',
    date: '2026-06-18',
    summary: 'Organize your notes and read the board at a glance.',
    highlights: [
      'Notes & Docs now supports nested folders — organize your markdown in a drag-and-drop folder tree, with a right-click “Move to…” menu.',
      'Board cards show smarter status: green when Claude is waiting for your prompt, and a pulsing orange when it needs a decision (permission, plan, or menu choice).',
      'A “What’s New” popup (this one!) now appears after each update.',
      'Usage Dashboard polish: roomier cards, cleaner chart tooltips.'

    summary: 'See your Claude Code usage at a glance.',
    highlights: [
      'New Usage Dashboard — click the token badge in the sidebar for charts of your usage: tokens over time, by model, by hour, and your most active projects.',
      'The sidebar token badge is now computed live from your sessions, so it always reflects the current day.'
